# Privacy-by-Design-Monitoring-Policy-Week-2-

## Principles Summary
Notice/consent principles say that the public should know what information is being collected
and be given the opportunity to agree to them, giving them more control over their information.
Purpose limitation says data should not be given out for any other purpose outside for the
reason it was originally intended to be collected for. This works well with the next principle, data
minimization, which is all about collecting only the necessary information and nothing more
than that. And finally, proportionality is all about preventing overreach and not invading their
systems for anymore personal information.

## My Monitoring & Retention Clause
G&G Industries monitors all access on the website to protect operations and comply with policy.
Monitoring is limited to authorized purposes and assigned scope. Users will receive notice upon
sign-in and through the AUP; personal communications are not reviewed unless required by law
or incident response to ensure maximum security and privacy.
G&G industries collects only the minimum amount of data necessary, restricts access to trained
staff, and retains monitoring data for 30 days unless G&G Industries is required to hold onto
data for investigations or legal holds. However, Once G&G Industries is no longer required to
hold onto suspected data, the individual/customers private data will then be removed from our
systems. To receive additional information regarding your rights, individualâ€™s/customers with
raised concerns or appeal with the practices described, the individual should contact G&G
industries by sending an email to GGIndustries@gmail.com. Misuse or violations may result in
the loss of access and/or disciplinary action.
