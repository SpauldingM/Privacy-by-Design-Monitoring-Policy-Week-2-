# Privacy-by-Design-Monitoring-Policy-Week-2-

Notice/consent principles say that the public should know what information is being collected
and be given the opportunity to agree to them, giving them more control over their information.
Purpose limitation says data should not be given out for any other purpose outside for the
reason it was originally intended to be collected for. This works well with the next principle, data
minimization, which is all about collecting only the necessary information and nothing more
than that. And finally, proportionality is all about preventing overreach and not invading their
systems for anymore personal information.
